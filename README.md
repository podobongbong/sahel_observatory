# UNISS Strategic Observatory in the Sahel
## üìå Overview
This repository documents the development of the Sahel Strategic Observatory, a joint inter-agency data initiative led by the Office of the Special Coordinator for Development in the Sahel (OSCDS). In response to geopolitical shifts in the Sahel region and emerging demands for data-driven foresight and early warning, this project aims to establish an integrated platform that consolidates internal and external data to support evidence-based decision-making.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Map operational data** under the UNISS framework using an updated 5W model (Who does What, Where, When, and for Whom).
- **Integrate operational and open-source data** (e.g., ACLED, WorldPop, climate models) to provide contextual foresight.
- **Visualize risks, gaps, and trends** to support strategic decision-making and resource prioritization.
- **Foster inter-agency data collaboration** through a shared technical framework and coordinated platform.

## üß© Key Components

The Sahel Strategic Observatory is designed as a modular platform, integrating three core components that work together to provide foresight, track operations, and support strategic decision-making.

### 1. üó∫Ô∏è UN Operation Mapping (5W)   
**Purpose**: To provide timeseries mapping of UN agency presence and activities across the Sahel.  
**Features**:
- Tracks Who is doing What, Where, When, and for Whom (5W) under UNISS
- Revives and upgrades the 2021 5W mapping exercise
- Includes new context-sensitive questions:
  - How AES withdrawal has affected project implementation
  - How global funding cuts have influenced programming

### 2. üîç Strategic Context & Forecasting
**Purpose**: To visualize and interpret regional trends using open-source and contextual data.  
**Features**:
- Integration of external datasets (ACLED, WorldPop, UNHCR, FEWSNET, climate models)
- Scenario-based spatial forecasting and early warning insights
- Thematic layers: conflict, displacement, food insecurity, climate variability

### 3. üìä Integrated Power BI Dashboard  
**Purpose**: To offer a unified, interactive interface for visual analysis.  
**Dashboard Modules**:
- **1) Operational Footprint Module (5W)** ‚Äì Who is doing what, where, when, and for whom, with overlays of budget and partner info.
- **2) Contextual Shocks Module (AES + Budget Cuts)** ‚Äì Visualize how geopolitical and financial shifts have affected UN operations.  
- **3) Risk Forecasting Module** ‚Äì Forward-looking trends using open data (e.g., climate, displacement, conflict). Grounded in historical patterns + scenario modeling.  
- **4) Strategic Foresight & Gaps Module** ‚Äì Pulls from Modules 1‚Äì3 to flag blind spots, under-resourced areas, and strategic needs. Designed for leadership briefings and donor engagement.
Each module contributes to a dynamic, data-informed decision-support system tailored to UN leadership and partners operating in the Sahel region.


## üìÖ Project Timeline (2025)
- **May**: Finalization of ToR and concept note
- **June‚ÄìJuly**: Indicator framework development, agency consultations
- **Aug‚ÄìOct**: Prototype development, data consolidation
- **Nov‚ÄìDec**: Testing, feedback, and launch

## Technologies Used

- Power BI
- Python (data processing and geospatial analysis)
- SQL (data querying)
- Streamlit (public-facing mockup interface)

## Collaboration & Data Policy

This platform is a collaborative effort. While the initial prototype is based on open data and internal mapping exercises, agencies are welcome to contribute validated datasets to enhance analysis and foresight. Data sharing is voluntary and can be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.
