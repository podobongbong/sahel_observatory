## üìÖ Timeline of Coordination Activities

### **April 2024** ‚Äì Initial Conceptualization
- The Observatory idea emerged following the AES countries' withdrawal from ECOWAS.
- UN leadership requested scenario planning and contingency mechanisms.
- Conceptual reference inspired by UNOCC/JMAC early warning approaches.

### **May 2024** ‚Äì Concept Note Developed
- Initial draft of the **Concept Note** prepared under the leadership of UNOCC.
- Document outlined the need for integrated foresight and data platform in the Sahel.

### **December 2024** ‚Äì Kickoff Meeting
- The first interagency meeting convened to discuss the Observatory‚Äôs feasibility.
- WhatsApp group and email communication channels created to sustain coordination.
- Draft ToR and thematic areas proposed for further exploration.

### **March 2025** ‚Äì Second Coordination Meeting
- Meeting held with key agencies (IOM, UNODC, UNOWAS, ECA, UNDCO).
- OSCDS highlighted the need for practical, short-term deliverables and review of data availability.
- Recommendations made to build an internal working group and establish clear ToRs.
- Integration with existing early warning tools (e.g., IOM ETT, UNOWAS PowerBI platform) discussed.

### **May 2025** ‚Äì Major Design Reframe & 5W Revitalization
- Strategic alignment between the Observatory and the 5W Mapping Exercise proposed.
- New structure drafted with four thematic dashboard modules:
  1. AES Impact
  2. Budget Cut Implications
  3. Forecasting
  4. Gap Analysis
- OSCDS team endorsed the initiative and technical ownership of the Observatory dashboard.
- Coordination initiated with UNDP Seoul Policy Centre (USPC) regarding potential IATI integration (03 June 2025).

### **11 June 2025** ‚Äì UNISS Cross-Pillar Meeting
- OSCDS presented the Observatory to UNISS Agencies
- Agencies agreed to support survey design and data sharing
- ECA offered geospatial data support and platform demo

### **12 June 2025** ‚Äì Exchange with UNDP Seoul Policy Centre

### **30 June 2025** ‚Äì Strategic Feedback from USG Mar
- Cautioned against over-relying on AI or biased media data‚Äîemphasized focus on development, not just crisis.
- Questioned the strategic value of ODA tracking‚Äîrelevance must be clearly defined.
- Stressed the need for contextual understanding when interpreting data, especially for predictive analytics.
- Highlighted importance of having technically skilled members in the Working Group.

## üîç Principles Guiding Coordination

- **Voluntary Collaboration**: All AFP engagements are based on mutual interest and non-obligatory participation.
- **Transparency**: Prototypes and metadata will be openly shared to facilitate feedback and avoid duplication.
- **Complementarity**: The Observatory does not aim to replace or supersede existing mechanisms but to complement them strategically.
- **Respect for Mandates**: Data roles and technical responsibilities of other UN bodies are acknowledged and respected.

## üß≠ Next Steps (as of July 2025)
- Align with IATI efforts.
- Launch 5W questionnaire (July)
- Convene technical working group for indicator selection and dashboard co-design.
- Initiate open-data source mapping
