- **Transparency**: Prototypes and metadata will be openly shared to facilitate feedback and avoid duplication.
- **Complementarity**: The Observatory does not aim to replace or supersede existing mechanisms but to complement them strategically.
- **Respect for Mandates**: Data roles and technical responsibilities of other UN bodies are acknowledged and respected.
